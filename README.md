# T - a text processing language and utility

`t` is a concise language for manipulating text, replacing common usage patterns of Unix utilities like grep, sed, cut, awk, sort, and uniq.


![Histogram](histogram.svg)


## Usage

```
t [<flags>] <programme> [<file> ...]
```

## Example - top 20 most frequent words, lowercased

Using traditional Unix utilities:

```bash
tr -s '[:space:]' '\n' < file | tr A-Z a-z | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -20
```

The equivalent in `t` would be:

```bash
t 'sfld:20' file
```

Going through the programme step by step gives us:

| Op | State | Description |
|----|-------|-------------|
| | `[line, line, ...]` | lines of input |
| `s` | `[[word, word], [word], ...]` | split each line into words |
| `f` | `[word, word, word, ...]` | flatten into single list |
| `l` | `[word, word, word, ...]` | lowercase each word |
| `d` | `[[5, "the"], [3, "cat"], ...]` | dedupe with counts |
| `:20` | `[[5, "the"], [3, "cat"], ...]` | take first 20 |

```

## Data Model

By default, input is a flat stream of lines, with each input file's lines concatenated together: `[line, line, ...]`.

Most operators apply to each element of the current array individually. For example, `l` (lowercase) on `["Hello", "World"]` produces `["hello", "world"]`—each element is lowercased independently.

Operators come in three kinds:

- **Transform** (map): apply to each element. `l` on `["Hello", "World"]` → `["hello", "world"]`
- **Filter**: keep or remove elements. `/x/` on `["ax", "", "cx"]` → `["ax", "cx"]`
- **Reduce**: collapse array to a value. `#` on `["a", "b", "c"]` → `3`

Element-wise transforms (`u`, `l`, `t`, `n`, `r`, `+`) recurse through nested arrays automatically. Structural operators (`d`, `#`, `o`, `O`, selection) operate on the top-level array only—use `@` to apply them at deeper levels.

Selection (`0`, `:3`, `0,2:5,8`) is a reduce operator—it collapses the array to a subset. To apply selection within each element of a nested structure, use `@` to descend first.

Use `@` to descend into nested structures, `^` to ascend back up. 

## Type System

There are three types:

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| array | ordered collection of values |
| string | text |
| number | numeric value (converted from string via `n`) |

Input is always an array of strings (lines). Operators like `s` create nested arrays, `j` joins them back. Numbers only exist after explicit conversion with `n`, and are used by numeric operators like `+`.

## Split/Join Semantics

`s` and `j` are inverse operations—`sj` always returns the original value.

Arrays have a semantic "level" that determines how `s` splits and `j` joins:

| Array Level | `s` splits text into | `j` joins with |
|-------------|----------------------|----------------|
| file | lines | newline |
| line | words | space |
| word | chars | nothing |

`s` operates only on the direct text elements of an array—it does not recurse into nested arrays. To split at deeper levels, use `@` to descend first.

`j` joins the elements of each nested array back into text, reversing the effect of `s`. It does not flatten—use `@` to join at deeper levels.

### Operator Details

#### `s` - Split

Splits text elements of the current array according to the array's semantic level:

- **file** array → splits text into lines (on newlines)
- **line** array → splits text into words (on whitespace)
- **word** array → splits text into characters

Array elements are left unchanged—`s` does not recurse. Use `@` to descend and split at deeper levels.

```
# Split lines into words (line array)
["hello world", "foo bar"]  →  [["hello", "world"], ["foo", "bar"]]

# Split words into chars (word array, after sj)
["hello", "world"]  →  [["h","e","l","l","o"], ["w","o","r","l","d"]]
```

#### `S<delim>` - Split on Delimiter

Splits on a custom delimiter. Use a single character directly, or quotes for multi-character delimiters:

- `S,` splits on comma
- `S:` splits on colon
- `S"::"` splits on `::`

```
# Split CSV
"a,b,c"  →  ["a", "b", "c"]   (with S,)

# Split on ::
"a::b::c"  →  ["a", "b", "c"]   (with S"::")
```

#### `j` - Join

The inverse of `s`—joins nested arrays back into text using the appropriate delimiter for the array level. `sj` always returns the original value.

```
# Join words back into lines (after s)
[["hello", "world"], ["foo", "bar"]]  →  ["hello world", "foo bar"]

# Join chars back into words (after s@s)
[["h","e","l","l","o"], ["w","o","r","l","d"]]  →  ["hello", "world"]
```

#### `J<delim>` - Join with Delimiter

Joins array elements with a custom delimiter:

- `J,` joins with comma
- `J"\n"` joins with newline

```
["a", "b", "c"]  →  "a,b,c"   (with J,)
```

#### `f` - Flatten

Flattens nested arrays by one level. Non-array elements are kept as-is.

```
[["a", "b"], ["c"]]  →  ["a", "b", "c"]
[["a", ["b", "c"]], ["d"]]  →  ["a", ["b", "c"], "d"]   (only one level)
```

#### `l` - Lowercase

Converts all text to lowercase. Works recursively on arrays.

```
["Hello", "WORLD"]  →  ["hello", "world"]
```

#### `L<selection>` - Lowercase Selected

Lowercases only the elements at the specified indices:

```
["HELLO", "WORLD", "FOO"]  →  ["hello", "WORLD", "FOO"]   (with L0)
["HELLO", "WORLD", "FOO"]  →  ["hello", "world", "FOO"]   (with L:2)
```

#### `u` - Uppercase

Converts all text to uppercase. Works recursively on arrays.

```
["Hello", "world"]  →  ["HELLO", "WORLD"]
```

#### `U<selection>` - Uppercase Selected

Uppercases only the elements at the specified indices.

#### `r[<selection>]/<old>/<new>/` - Replace (Regex)

Replaces matches of regex `<old>` with `<new>`. Recurses through nested arrays.

With an optional selection, applies replacement only to elements at the specified indices.

```
# Remove prefix
["ERROR: fail", "ERROR: crash"]  →  ["fail", "crash"]   (with r/ERROR: //)

# Replace pattern
["cat", "hat"]  →  ["dog", "hat"]   (with r/cat/dog/)

# Replace only in first element
["cat", "cat"]  →  ["dog", "cat"]   (with r0/cat/dog/)
```

#### `n` - To Number

Converts strings to numbers. Recurses through nested arrays. Non-numeric strings error.

```
["42", "3.14", "100"]  →  [42, 3.14, 100]
```

#### `N<selection>` - To Number Selected

Converts only the elements at the specified indices to numbers.

#### `t` - Trim

Removes leading and trailing whitespace from each string. Recurses through nested arrays.

```
["  hello  ", "\tworld\n"]  →  ["hello", "world"]
```

#### `T<selection>` - Trim Selected

Trims only the elements at the specified indices.

#### `/<regex>/` - Filter Keep

Keeps only elements matching the regex.

```
["apple", "banana", "apricot"]  →  ["apple", "apricot"]   (with /^a/)
```

#### `!/<regex>/` - Filter Remove

Removes elements matching the regex (keeps non-matching).

```
["apple", "banana", "apricot"]  →  ["banana"]   (with !/^a/)
```

#### `m/<regex>/` - Match All

Extracts all regex matches from each element, returning an array of matches per element. This is the equivalent of `grep -o`.

```
# Extract all IP addresses from each line
["192.168.1.1 to 10.0.0.1", "from 172.16.0.1"]  →  [["192.168.1.1", "10.0.0.1"], ["172.16.0.1"]]
   (with m/\d+\.\d+\.\d+\.\d+/)

# Extract all numbers
"price: $42, qty: 7"  →  ["42", "7"]   (with m/\d+/)

# Get first match only
m/pattern/@0

# Flatten all matches into single list
m/pattern/f
```

#### `x` - Delete Empty

Removes empty strings and empty arrays from the current array.

```
["hello", "", "world", ""]  →  ["hello", "world"]
```

#### `<selection>` - Select

Selects elements by index, slice, or combination. See [Selection](#selection) for full syntax.

- Single index returns the element itself
- Multiple indices or slices return an array

Also works on strings, treating them as character arrays:

```
"hello"  →  "h"       (with 0)
"hello"  →  "olleh"   (with ::-1)
```

#### `o` - Sort Descending

Sorts the array in descending order. For arrays of arrays, sorts lexicographically (first element, then second, etc.).

```
[3, 1, 4, 1, 5]  →  [5, 4, 3, 1, 1]
[[2, "b"], [1, "a"], [2, "a"]]  →  [[2, "b"], [2, "a"], [1, "a"]]
```

#### `O` - Sort Ascending

Sorts the array in ascending order.

```
[3, 1, 4, 1, 5]  →  [1, 1, 3, 4, 5]
```

#### `g<selection>` - Group By

Groups elements by the value(s) at the specified selection. Produces `[[key, [elements...]], ...]`.

```
# Group by first element
[["a", 1], ["b", 2], ["a", 3]]  →  [["a", [["a", 1], ["a", 3]]], ["b", [["b", 2]]]]   (with g0)

# Group by slice (composite key)
g0:2  →  key is [first, second] elements
```

#### `d` - Dedupe with Counts

Removes duplicates and counts occurrences. Returns `[[count, value], ...]` sorted by count descending.

```
["a", "b", "a", "a", "b"]  →  [[3, "a"], [2, "b"]]
```

#### `D<selection>` - Dedupe by Field

Removes duplicates based on the value at the specified selection, counting occurrences. Returns `[[count, element], ...]` sorted by count descending.

```
# Dedupe by first element
[["a", 1], ["b", 2], ["a", 3]]  →  [[2, ["a", 1]], [1, ["b", 2]]]   (with D0)
```

#### `#` - Count

Returns the number of elements in the array.

```
["a", "b", "c"]  →  3
```

#### `+` - Sum

Sums all numeric values. Recurses through nested arrays. Strings are coerced to numbers (non-numeric strings contribute 0).

```
[1, 2, 3, 4]  →  10
[["1", "2"], ["3", "4"]]  →  10
```

#### `c` - Columnate

Formats array of arrays as aligned columns (like `column -t`). Each column width is automatically determined by the widest element in that column.

```
[["name", "age"], ["alice", "30"], ["bob", "25"]]
→
name   age
alice  30
bob    25
```

#### `p<selection>` - Partition

Splits an array or string at the specified indices. Each index becomes a split point.

```
# Split at index 2
["a", "b", "c", "d", "e"]  →  [["a", "b"], ["c", "d", "e"]]   (with p2)

# Split at multiple indices
["a", "b", "c", "d", "e"]  →  [["a"], ["b", "c"], ["d", "e"]]   (with p1,3)

# Chunk into groups of 2 (split at every 2nd index)
["a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f"]  →  [["a", "b"], ["c", "d"], ["e", "f"]]   (with p::2)
```

Also works on strings:

```
"hello"  →  ["he", "llo"]   (with p2)
"abcdef"  →  ["ab", "cd", "ef"]   (with p::2)
```

#### `@` - Descend

Descends one level into the data structure. Subsequent operations apply to each element of the current array, rather than the array itself.

```
# Without @: select first element of outer array
[["a", "b"], ["c", "d"]]  →  ["a", "b"]   (with 0)

# With @: select first element of EACH inner array
[["a", "b"], ["c", "d"]]  →  ["a", "c"]   (with @0)
```

Multiple `@` descends multiple levels:

```
# @@0 operates on elements of elements of elements
```

#### `^` - Ascend

Ascends one level, undoing a previous `@`. Returns focus to the parent array.

```
# Split, descend, select first word, ascend
"hello world\nfoo bar"  →  ["hello", "foo"]   (with s@0)
```

#### `;` - Separator

A no-op operator that does nothing. Useful for visually separating groups of operators in complex programmes.

```
# Without separator
s@0^do:10

# With separator for readability
s@0^;d;o;:10
```

## Selection

Selection is a reduce operator—it collapses the array to a subset. Selecting a single element returns that element; selecting multiple returns an array:

| Syntax | Meaning | Result |
|--------|---------|--------|
| `<n>` | single index (0-based) | element |
| `-<n>` | negative index (from end) | element |
| `<n>:<m>` | slice (exclusive end) | array |
| `<n>:` | slice to end | array |
| `:<m>` | slice from start | array |
| `<n>:<m>:<s>` | slice with stride | array |
| `<n>,<m>,<p>` | select multiple | array |
| `<n>,<m>:<p>` | mixed index + slice | array |

To apply selection within each element of a nested structure, use `@` to descend first:

```bash
# Select first 3 lines
t ':3' file

# Split lines into words, then select first word of each line
t 's@0' file

# Split on colon, select first and last fields of each line
t 'S:@0,-1' /etc/passwd

# Split into words, select 1st, 3rd, 4th of each line
t 's@0,2,3' file

# Reorder columns: last column first, then rest
t 's@-1,0:-1' file
```

## Grouping

`g<selection>` groups elements by the value(s) at the specified selection, producing `[[key, [element, ...]], ...]`.

| Syntax | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `g0` | group by first element |
| `g-1` | group by last element |
| `g1,2` | group by composite key (elements 1 and 2) |
| `g0:3` | group by first three elements as key |

Examples:

```bash
# Group log lines by IP (first field)
t 'sg0' access.log
# → [["192.168.1.1", [[192.168.1.1, -, -, ...], ...]], ["10.0.0.5", [...]], ...]

# Group CSV rows by region (field 2)
t 'S,g2' sales.csv

# Group by composite key: method + status code
t 'sg0,8' access.log

# Group by IP (first field), showing all requests per IP
t 'sg0' access.log
# → [["192.168.1.1", [[...], [...]]], ["10.0.0.5", [[...]]]]

# Group by IP, show top 10 offenders with their actual requests
t 'sg0o:10' access.log
```

## Aggregation & Cleaning

| Operator | Behavior | Example |
|----------|----------|---------|
| `#` | count: `[a, b, c]` → `3` | `t '#' file` (line count) |
| `+` | sum: `[1, 2, 3]` → `6` | `t 'S,@1n+' data.csv` (sum column 2) |
| `t` | trim whitespace (per element) | `t 't' file` (trim each line) |
| `x` | delete empty elements | `t 'x' file` (remove blank lines) |

## Interactive Mode

Interactive mode allows a user to live preview programmes as they're typed.
Pressing `^J` will toggle between text and JSON modes.

```bash
$ t -i access.log
Loaded 124847 lines
t> s                     # live preview as you type
[[192.168.1.1, -, -, ...], [10.0.0.5, -, -, ...], ...]
t> s@8
["200", "404", "200", "500", ...]
t> s@8^d
[[98423, "200"], [1042, "404"], [89, "500"], ...]
t> s@8^do
[[98423, "200"], [1042, "404"], [89, "500"], ...]
t> s@8^do:10<Enter>      # enter commits
```

## CLI Flags

| Flag | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `-d <delim>` | input delimiter (what `s` splits on) |
| `-D <delim>` | output delimiter (what `j` joins with) |
| `-c` | CSV mode (split/join handle quoted fields) |
| `-e <prog>` | explain |
| `-p <prog>` | parse tree |
| `-i` | interactive |
| `-j` | json output |

## Rosetta Stone

### Filtering

**Lines with "fail" but not "expected":**
```bash
grep fail file | grep -v expected
t '/fail/!/expected/' file
```

**Error messages, deduped and sorted by frequency:**
```bash
grep ERROR app.log | sed 's/.*ERROR: //' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn
t '/ERROR/r/.*ERROR: //do' app.log
```

### Field Selection

**Select specific columns (1st, 3rd, 4th) from whitespace-delimited file:**
```bash
awk '{print $1, $3, $4}' file
t 's@0,2,3' file
```

**Extract username and shell from /etc/passwd:**
```bash
awk -F: '{print $1, $7}' /etc/passwd
t 'S:@0,-1' /etc/passwd
```

**Reorder CSV columns (swap first two, keep rest):**
```bash
awk -F, -v OFS=, '{print $2, $1, $3}' file
t 'S,@1,0,2:J,' file
```

**Colon-delimited: 5th field, lowercased, reversed:**
```bash
cut -d: -f5 /etc/passwd | tr A-Z a-z | rev
t 'S:@4ls::-1j' /etc/passwd
```

### Grouping

**Group log lines by IP, see all requests from each:**
```bash
# No simple Unix equivalent - requires awk with arrays
awk '{a[$1] = a[$1] ? a[$1] "\n" $0 : $0} END {for (k in a) print "==" k "==\n" a[k]}' access.log
t 'sg0' access.log
```

**Group errors by error type, show all occurrences:**
```bash
# Complex in traditional tools
t '/ERROR/r/.*ERROR: //sg0' app.log
```

**Group by field:**
```bash
# No simple Unix equivalent - requires awk with arrays
t 'sg0' access.log
```

**Group CSV by category (column 3), extract values (column 2):**
```bash
awk -F, '{a[$3] = a[$3] " " $2} END {for (k in a) print k, a[k]}' data.csv
t 'S,g2@1@1' data.csv
```

### Frequency & Deduplication

**Request counts by IP (first field of log):**
```bash
awk '{print $1}' access.log | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn
t 's@0^do' access.log
```

**HTTP status code distribution (9th field):**
```bash
awk '{print $9}' access.log | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn
t 's@8^do' access.log
```

**Most requested URLs (7th field), top 20:**
```bash
awk '{print $7}' access.log | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -20
t 's@6^do:20' access.log
```

**Top 10 file extensions:**
```bash
ls -1 | grep '\.' | rev | cut -d. -f1 | rev | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -10
t '/\./S.@-1^do:10' filelist
```

**CSV: value frequency in column 1:**
```bash
cut -d, -f1 data.csv | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn
t 'S,@0^do' data.csv
```

**CSV: unique values in column 3, sorted:**
```bash
cut -d, -f3 data.csv | sort -u
t 'S,@2^DO' data.csv
```

**Extract and count email domains:**
```bash
grep -E '@' file | sed 's/.*@//' | sed 's/[^a-zA-Z0-9.-].*//' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn
t '/@/S@@-1^do' file
```

**Remove duplicate words within each line:**
```bash
awk '{delete a; for(i=1;i<=NF;i++) if(!a[$i]++) printf "%s ", $i; print ""}' file
t 's@D0@1^J" "' file
```

### Counting & Aggregation

**Count lines (like wc -l):**
```bash
wc -l < file
t '#' file
```

**Count words (like wc -w):**
```bash
wc -w < file
t 'sf#' file
```

**Sum a column of numbers:**
```bash
awk '{sum+=$1} END{print sum}' file
t 'n+' file
```

**Sum column 2 of a CSV:**
```bash
awk -F, '{sum+=$2} END{print sum}' data.csv
t 'S,@1n+' data.csv
```

### Cleaning & Transformation

**Remove blank lines:**
```bash
sed '/^$/d' file
t 'x' file
```

**Trim whitespace from each line:**
```bash
sed 's/^[ \t]*//;s/[ \t]*$//' file
t 't' file
```

**Reverse words within each line:**
```bash
awk '{for(i=NF;i>=1;i--) printf "%s ", $i; print ""}' file
t 's@::-1j' file
```

**Reverse each word's characters (hello world → olleh dlrow):**
```bash
# Bash equivalent is ugly:
while IFS= read -r line; do echo "$line" | xargs -n1 | rev | xargs; done < file
t 's@s@::-1^j^j' file
```

### Extraction

**Extract all IP addresses from log file (like grep -o):**
```bash
grep -oE '[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+' access.log
t 'm/[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+/f' access.log
```

**Extract all numbers from text:**
```bash
grep -oE '[0-9]+' file
t 'm/[0-9]+/f' file
```

**Extract email addresses:**
```bash
grep -oE '[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}' file
t 'm/[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}/f' file
```

### Slicing

**Every 3rd line, starting from line 2:**
```bash
awk 'NR%3==2' file
t '1::3' file
```
